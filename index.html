		<p>I'm Dong Liu (He/him/his). Currently, I'm studying UX design at University of Michiganâ€™s School of Information as an exchange student from Uppsala University (Sweden) where I study Game Design.</p>
		<p>I'm passionate about creating pleasurable digital experiences to make life easier. Therefore, I started my journey to experience different cultures and expand my understanding of users and the world. In the past 5 years, I lived in 4 countries on 3 continents. I believe the global vision I gained from both eastern and western culture can enrich my creativity to solve global issues with other aspiring individuals.</p>
		<p>Looking forward to applying my knowledge and skills to UX Design in related fields. </p>
